Problem Statement

Monitoring boats operating along the Red Sea coast, from Al-Qunfudhah in the south to Rabigh in the north, is becoming more difficult for the Jeddah Municipality. The lack of a centralized digital monitoring system has made it challenging to track boats' current whereabouts, which has a detrimental effect on safety, compliance, and operational effectiveness.

Proposed Solution

The system proposed is one that incorporates chip-based identification with GPS tracking in real-time. All the registered boats are displayed on an interactive, full-screen digital map, which covers a region starting from Al Qunfudhah to Rabigh. The system uses color coding to indicate the status of each boat:
Green  Boat is operating within time and space limits safely
Yellow  Boat is near violation ( approaching boundary or time limit)
Red  Boat has broken rules (surpassed time or left area allowed)
The system also involves filtering options to show the boats by category: safe, warning, violation, or all. Alerts are given when boats leave permitted areas or exceed allowed time to immediately make those visible to operators. The solution is designed for continuous monitoring, fast response, and ease of use.
